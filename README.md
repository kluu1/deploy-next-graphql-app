### Available Scripts
Once you have pulled the code and change into the project director, the following scripts are available to you

```npm run dev```
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

```npm run build```
Builds the app for production to the .next folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

```npm run start```
Starts the application in production mode. The application should be compiled with `next build` first.

```heroku-postbuild```
Used when deploying your Next.js app to Heroku
